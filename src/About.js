    <p>This is a very early stage project started by Code for Asheville members at the 2018 National Day of Civic Hacking.  Our hope is to foster collaboration between community organizations and connectivity between individuals by revealing our common interests.</p>
    <p>We have a lot more work to do.  If you know of any community groups working on a similar project, we would love to connect with them and figure out how to share data!
